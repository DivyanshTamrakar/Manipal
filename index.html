						</h3>
						<!-- <span>Posted : Feb. 16, 2012</span> -->
						<p>
							Manipur has a long and glorious history from the beginning of the Christian era. The
							recorded history of kingship started from 33 A.D., which marked the coronation of Pakhangba.
							After Pakhangba, a series of kings ruled over the kingdom of Manipur. The independence and
							sovereignty of Manipur remained uninterrupted until the Burmese invaded and occupied it for
							seven years in the first quarter of the 19th century (1819-25). Then came British
							Paramountcy in 1891, and later on it was merged in the Indian Union as part "C" State on 15
							October, 1949. This was replaced by a Territorial Council of 30 elected and 2 nominated
							members. Later in 1963, a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected and 3 nominated members was
							established under the Union Territories Act, 1962. The status of the administrator was
							raised from Chief Commissioner to the status of the Lt. Governor with effect from 19
							December, 1969. Manipur attained full-fledged statehood on 21 January, 1972. With this, a
							Legislative Assembly consisting of 60 elected members was established.

							Manipur is situated on the eastern frontier of India. It is bounded on the east by Myammar
							(Burma), on the north by the State of Nagaland, on the west by the State of Assam and on the
							south by the State of Mizoram and Myanmar. Manipur lies between 23.830 N and 25.680 N
							latitude and between 93.030 E and 94.780 E longitude. It has an area of 22,327 sq. kms.
							Physically Manipur comprises of two parts, the hills and the valley. The valley is at the
							centre surrounded by hills on all sides. The hills cover about 9/10 of the total area of the
							State. Manipur Valley is about 790 metres above the sea level. The hill ranges are higher on
							the north and gradually diminish in height as they reach the southern part of Manipur. The
							valley itself slopes down towards the south.

						<p>
							Agriculture and allied activities is the only mainstay of the State's economy where about 70
							percent of the population depends on it. The State has two topographical zones - valley and
							hills. The valley is known as the 'Rice Bowl' of the State. The valley has sub-tropical to
							sub-temperate climate with an average altitude of 3000 metres above MSL. The State has
							distinct winter, warm, humid and rainy summer. The average rainfall covering the State is
							1436 mm. It occurs mainly during June to September when the State is under the spell of
							South West Monsoon. The growth of the agriculture in the State has been quite uneven and
							unsatisfactory for the reason that its production still depends on seasonal rainfall.

							According to the State Forest Report, 2009 prepared by Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, the
							forest cover in the State is 17,280 sq km, which is 77.40 per cent of the State's
							geographical area. In terms of forest canopy density classes, the State has 701 sq km very
							dense forests, 5474 sq km moderately dense forest and 11.105 sq km open forests. Comparison
							of the current forest cover with the previous assessment in 2005 shows and overall increase
